# Firebase Storage & Firestore Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up Firebase Storage and Firestore for your Construction Management application to properly store and manage PDF files and quotation/invoice history.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/firebase.js`)
- Added Firebase Storage and Firestore initialization
- Created utility functions for PDF management:
  - `uploadPDFToStorage()` - Upload PDFs to Firebase Storage
  - `getAllPDFs()` - Retrieve all PDF metadata from Firestore
  - `updatePDFMetadata()` - Update quotation/invoice information
  - `deletePDF()` - Remove PDFs from both Storage and Firestore

### 2. Updated Quotation Component (`src/Quotation.js`)
- Modified `saveToHistory()` function to use Firebase Storage
- Added automatic PDF upload when quotations/invoices are generated
- Maintains localStorage fallback for offline functionality
- Stores minimal metadata to avoid storage limitations

### 3. Enhanced History Component (`src/History.js`)
- Updated to load data from Firebase first, then localStorage as fallback
- Added PDF viewing capabilities with "View PDF" button
- Added direct PDF download functionality
- Enhanced delete functionality for Firebase-stored items
- Added refresh button for manual data reload

### 4. New Features Added
- **View PDF**: Opens PDFs in new browser tab
- **Download PDF**: Direct download of stored PDF files
- **Enhanced Search**: Search through Firebase-stored data
- **Persistent Storage**: PDFs survive page refreshes and browser sessions
- **Cloud Backup**: All data automatically backed up to Firebase

## Firebase Console Setup

### Step 1: Firebase Storage Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Your Project â†’ Storage â†’ Rules
2. Replace the default rules with the content from `firebase-storage-rules.txt`
3. Click "Publish"

### Step 2: Firestore Database Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Your Project â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules
2. Replace the default rules with the content from `firestore-rules.txt`
3. Click "Publish"

### Step 3: Enable Services
Make sure these services are enabled in your Firebase project:
- **Firebase Storage**: For storing PDF files
- **Firestore Database**: For storing quotation/invoice metadata
- **Firebase Authentication** (optional): For user-specific access

## Security Rules Explanation

### Storage Rules
- **Authenticated Access**: Only logged-in users can read/write files
- **File Size Limits**: PDFs limited to 10MB, other files to 5MB
- **File Type Restrictions**: Only PDF files allowed in `/pdfs/` folder
- **Public Alternative**: Commented section for development/testing

### Firestore Rules
- **Data Validation**: Ensures required fields are present
- **Type Safety**: Validates data types and value ranges
- **Timestamp Protection**: Prevents modification of creation timestamps
- **User Permissions**: Authenticated users can read/write quotation data

## How It Works

### PDF Storage Flow
1. User generates quotation/invoice PDF
2. PDF automatically uploaded to Firebase Storage (`/pdfs/` folder)
3. Metadata saved to Firestore (`quotations` collection)
4. Download URL stored for easy access
5. History page displays all stored items

### Data Structure

#### Firebase Storage
```
/pdfs/
  â”œâ”€â”€ quotation_QTN-123456_1696234567890.pdf
  â”œâ”€â”€ invoice_INV-789012_1696234567891.pdf
  â””â”€â”€ ...
```

#### Firestore Database
```javascript
// Collection: quotations
{
  id: "auto-generated-id",
  type: "quotation", // or "invoice"
  quotationNumber: "QTN-123456",
  customerName: "John Doe",
  siteLocationName: "Project Site A",
  totalAmount: 50000,
  filename: "quotation_QTN-123456_1696234567890.pdf",
  downloadURL: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...",
  storageRef: "pdfs/quotation_QTN-123456_1696234567890.pdf",
  materials: [...],
  billTo: {...},
  siteLocation: {...},
  company: {...},
  invoice: {...},
  taxRates: {...},
  discountPercent: 0,
  createdAt: "2024-10-02T10:30:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-10-02T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Persistent Storage
- PDFs survive browser refreshes and computer restarts
- Data accessible from any device with internet connection
- No more lost quotations/invoices

### 2. Cloud Backup
- Automatic backup to Google's servers
- 99.95% uptime guarantee
- Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery

### 3. Scalability
- Handles unlimited number of PDFs
- No localStorage size limitations
- Automatic compression and optimization

### 4. Enhanced Features
- Direct PDF viewing in browser
- Easy download functionality
- Advanced search and filtering
- Real-time data synchronization

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Generate PDFs**: Use the normal quotation/invoice generation process
2. **View History**: Click "History" to see all stored items
3. **View PDFs**: Click "ðŸ“„ View PDF" to open in new tab
4. **Download**: Click "ðŸ’¾ Download" to save file locally
5. **Search**: Use search bar to find specific quotations/invoices
6. **Refresh**: Click "ðŸ”„ Refresh" to reload latest data

### For Developers
1. **Authentication**: Consider adding user authentication for production
2. **Error Handling**: Monitor console for Firebase operation status
3. **Offline Support**: LocalStorage fallback ensures offline functionality
4. **Monitoring**: Use Firebase Console to monitor usage and performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Firebase not initialized**: Check if `firebase.js` is properly imported
2. **Permission denied**: Verify Firebase rules are published
3. **Large file uploads**: Check file size limits in storage rules
4. **Network errors**: Ensure internet connection for Firebase operations

### Debugging
- Check browser console for Firebase operation logs
- Monitor Firebase Console for real-time data
- Test localStorage fallback by going offline

## Cost Considerations

### Firebase Pricing
- **Storage**: ~$0.026/GB/month
- **Downloads**: ~$0.12/GB
- **Database Operations**: Free tier includes 50K reads/writes per day
- **Bandwidth**: Free tier includes 1GB/day

### Optimization Tips
- PDFs are compressed during generation
- Metadata stored efficiently in Firestore
- Old items can be automatically archived
- Consider implementing pagination for large datasets

## Security Best Practices

1. **Enable Authentication**: For production deployment
2. **Regular Rule Updates**: Review and update security rules
3. **Monitor Access**: Use Firebase Console to monitor unusual activity
4. **Backup Strategy**: Consider additional backup solutions for critical data
5. **User Permissions**: Implement role-based access if needed
